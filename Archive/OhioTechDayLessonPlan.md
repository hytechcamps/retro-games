# Ohio Tech Day Lesson Plan: Retro Games
A workshop introducing [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) in ~1.5hrs. Microsoft MakeCode Arcade is a web-based beginner-friendly code editor to create retro arcade games for the web and for dedicated hardware.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Recognize the historic importance of Donkey Kong
- Drag blocks to create scripts with block-based programming
- Understand how code creates games

## Lesson Outline
This lesson has three main parts, with opportunities for tangential learning as well.

### Lecture: Retro Games
Present the [Retro Games PowerPoint Presentation](RetroGames.pptx). There are notes in the slides. Make sure to keep this relatively quick. The final slide contains a URL for the students to visit - this is where they will begin the code-along.

### Code-Along: Platformer
Walk through the [Code-Along](CodeAlong.md) with the students. Start by showing one example of what MakeCode Arcade can build with the jumpy platformer, and explaining the basic layout of the site. Then, step through each section, and ensure that the students are following along.

#### Deviations
The students should be able to:

- Name their "Main Character" sprite something different
- Draw their own character, tile, and map
- Change the values for the controller `vx`, the gravity `ay`, the jump `vy`, the animation `interval`, and the `game over` effects

Other than those things, they should follow the instructor's code.

### Supplemental: Sharing Games & Challenges
If there is time remaining after the completion of the code-along activity, students should be encouraged to share their games, and continue working on them. Students can go to [**tinyurl.com/retrores**](https://tinyurl.com/retrores) to access the instructions.

#### Sharing Games
They can share their games by following [these instructions](SharingGames.md). This can also be a good way for instructors to help debug the students' games during the session.

All game submissions can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q6ySJj4qS4g7QVyYaRa_wdv67dHlkpm9cEsvJcHzHZQ/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Challenges
The goal of the [challenges](Challenges.md) is to inspire the students to continue playing with MakeCode Arcade. They provide some direction for the students to add features to their game. It is not necessary for the students to follow the challenge guidelines directly, as long as they continue to work on game development.

Students are generally interested in learning about [Piskel](https://piskelapp.com), so that can be a fun thing to show if there is time at the end.

### Formative Assessment: Blooket
Close out the lesson by facilitating the [Blooket quiz game](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/65084d4418adbc094405e876). This quiz covers content from the lecture as well as the code-along activity.
