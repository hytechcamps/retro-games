# Sketch Icebreaker
Go to https://sketch.io/sketchpad/ to get started! Once there, use the tools available to create a video game character. It can be an existing character, or a completely original one!

After about **five minutes** of draw time, each student will have a chance to share their drawing.

## Sharing Sketches
If possible, use Zoom's Screen Share tool to share the drawing with the rest of the group. If not, it will be necessary to share a link to the drawing instead.
