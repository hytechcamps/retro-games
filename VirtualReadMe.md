# VIRTUAL: Retro Games with MakeCode Arcade
A workshop introducing [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) in ~1.5hrs. Microsoft MakeCode Arcade is a web-based beginner-friendly code editor to create retro arcade games for the web and for dedicated hardware.

## Suggested Schedule (Virtual)

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| Icebreaker | 15m |
| Virtual Lecture | 10m |
| Virtual Kahoot | 5m |
| Code-Along | 45m |
| Individual | 15m |

## Individual Drawing Icebreaker
Start things off with an icebreaker activity so the students can get to know each other. Students can follow the instructions on [this page](Icebreaker.md) if desired.

1. Go to https://sketch.io/sketchpad/
1. Show the students how to draw something simple
1. Share the link to the site in the chat
1. After ~5m, have the students introduce themselves and share their drawings
    - Make sure to keep the introductions brief

## Virtual Lecture
The [virtual lecture](RetroGamesVirtual.pptx) introduces retro games with a little less background information.

## Virtual Kahoot
The [virtual Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/duplicate-of-retro-games/12625252-42b6-4b7f-94d4-d0b61ac21f6c) covers the content from the virtual lecture.

## Code-Along
Walk through the [Code-Along](CodeAlong.md) with the students. Start building a simple platformer using MakeCode Arcade. For the virtual camp, _skip the optional animation section_.

Make sure to keep the "jumpy platformer" introduction time-bound. After a certain amount of time (2-3 minutes), tell the students it is time to stop. After that, share the code-along instructions in the Zoom chat and begin walking through it.

### Deviations
The students should be able to:

- Name their "Main Character" sprite something different
- Draw their own character, tile, and map
- Change the values for the controller `vx`, the gravity `ay`, the jump `vy`, the animation `interval`, and the `game over` effects

Other than those things, they should follow the instructor's code.

## Challenges
The goal of the [challenges](Challenges.md) is to inspire the students to continue playing with MakeCode Arcade. They provide some direction for the students to add features to their game. It is not necessary for the students to follow the challenge guidelines directly, as long as they continue to work on game development. Students can access the challenges via the [external GitBook site](https://hytechcamps.github.io/retro-games/Challenges.html).
