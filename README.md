## Icebreaker
Start things off with a quick icebreaker activity so the students can get to know each other.

- Collaborative Drawing: Start up a painting on [aggie.io](https://aggie.io/) and give the students the link. Task them with collaboratively drawing something like a city, e.g. [this](https://i.imgur.com/s0gjcMq.jpg). It should be something where every student has an opportunity to participate. It may be beneficial to start with a template/background layer and have the students build on top of it.

## Lecture
The lecture uses a [PowerPoint Presentation](RetroGames.pptx) to introduce students to retro games. It covers the history of video games, pixel art, making a game with MakeCode Arcade.
