# Retro Games with MakeCode Arcade
A workshop introducing [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) in ~2hrs. Microsoft MakeCode Arcade is a web-based beginner-friendly code editor to create retro arcade games for the web and for dedicated hardware.

## Icebreaker
Start things off with an icebreaker activity so the students can get to know each other.

- Collaborative Drawing: Start up a painting on [aggie.io](https://aggie.io/) and give the students the link. Task them with collaboratively drawing something like a city, e.g. [this](https://i.imgur.com/s0gjcMq.jpg). It should be something where every student has an opportunity to participate. It may be beneficial to start with a template/background layer and have the students build on top of it. Make sure to sign-in and become an admin of the drawing, that way it will be possible to kick students if necessary.

## Lecture
The lecture uses a [PowerPoint Presentation](RetroGames.pptx) to introduce students to retro games.

### Virtual Lecture
The [virtual lecture](RetroGamesVirtual.pptx) introduces retro games with a little less information.

## Kahoot
The [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/d71c1d5e-a563-4e00-a61a-fa498c71942b) covers the content from the lecture.

### Virtual Kahoot
The [virtual Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/duplicate-of-retro-games/12625252-42b6-4b7f-94d4-d0b61ac21f6c) covers the content from the virtual lecture.

## Code-Along
Walk through the [Code-Along](CodeAlong.md) with the students. Start building a simple platformer using MakeCode Arcade.

### Virtual Note
When facilitating this camp virtually, skip the optional animation section.

### Deviations
The students should be able to:

- Name their "Main Character" sprite something different
- Draw their own character, tile, and map
- Change the values for the controller `vx`, the gravity `ay`, the jump `vy`, the animation `interval`, and the `game over` effects

Other than those things, they should follow the instructor's code.

## Challenges
The goal of the [challenges](Challenges.md) is to inspire the students to continue playing with MakeCode Arcade. They provide some direction for the students to add features to their game. It is not necessary for the students to follow the challenge guidelines directly, as long as they continue to work on game development.
