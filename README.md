# Designing Retro Games with MakeCode Arcade
A workshop introducing [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) in ~2hrs. Microsoft MakeCode Arcade is a web-based beginner-friendly code editor to create retro arcade games for the web and for dedicated hardware.

## Description
In this workshop, students will explore the history of video games, and then create a retro-style game of their own. They will use Microsoft MakeCode Arcade, a web-based beginner-friendly code editor, to build a platformer game. They will be able to develop the gameplay, art assets, game map, and more. By the end of the workshop, they will have a fully functioning arcade game of their own design.

| Kahoot | 10m |
| Break | 10m |
| Code-Along | 45m |
| Individual | 50m |

## Collaborative Drawing Icebreaker
Start things off with an icebreaker activity so the students can get to know each other.

Start up a painting on [aggie.io](https://aggie.io/). Ahead of time, import a template image with several squares. Become an admin, and configure the drawing so that only "Approved" users can own layers. Give the students the link, and ask them to draw their favorite video game characters in one square each. Show the students how to change their name, and once they do, add them to the "Approved" users list. After about five minutes, go around the room and ask each student to briefly introduce themselves (name, school, drawing).

## Lecture
The lecture uses a [PowerPoint Presentation](RetroGames.pptx) to introduce students to retro games.

## Kahoot
The [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/d71c1d5e-a563-4e00-a61a-fa498c71942b) covers the content from the lecture.

## Code-Along
Walk through the [Code-Along](CodeAlong.md) with the students. Start building a simple platformer using MakeCode Arcade.

### Deviations
The students should be able to:

- Name their "Main Character" sprite something different
- Draw their own character, tile, and map
- Change the values for the controller `vx`, the gravity `ay`, the jump `vy`, the animation `interval`, and the `game over` effects

Other than those things, they should follow the instructor's code.

## Challenges
The goal of the [challenges](Challenges.md) is to inspire the students to continue playing with MakeCode Arcade. They provide some direction for the students to add features to their game. It is not necessary for the students to follow the challenge guidelines directly, as long as they continue to work on game development. Students can access the challenges via the [external GitBook site](https://hytechcamps.github.io/retro-games/Challenges.html).
